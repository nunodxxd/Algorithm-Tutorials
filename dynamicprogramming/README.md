# Dynamic programming

Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.

# Code Explanation 

Dynamic programming algorithm can bu used on Fibonacci algorithm.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), which is much faster than the exponential time complexity of a simple recursive solution.

Dynamic programming is widely used for optimization problems, where we are trying to find out the minimum or maximum solution of a problem. The dynamic programming guarantees to find the optimal solution of a problem if the solution exists.
