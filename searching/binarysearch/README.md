# Binarysearch

The Binary Search algorithm is a search algorithm that works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It starts by comparing the target value to the middle element of the sorted array. If the target value matches the middle element, the search is complete. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues on the lower half of the array. If the target value is greater than the middle element, the search continues on the upper half of the array. This process is repeated until the target value is found or the search interval is empty.

# Code Explanation

In the code, the binary_search function takes in two arguments: arr, which is the sorted array to be searched, and target, which is the value to be searched for. The function initializes two pointers, left and right, to the beginning and end of the array, respectively. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as left is less than or equal to right. Within the loop, the function calculates the middle index of the search interval using integer division and compares the middle element to the target value. If the middle element is equal to the target value, the function returns the index of the middle element. If the middle element is less than the target value, the search continues on the right half of the array by updating the left pointer to mid + 1. If the middle element is greater than the target value, the search continues on the left half of the array by updating the right pointer to mid - 1. If the target value is not found after the loop completes, the function returns -1 to indicate that the target value is not in the array.
Overall, the Binary Search algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n), making it a very efficient search algorithm for large, sorted arrays.
