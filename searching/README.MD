# Hashtable vs Binary Search

This document provides a comparison between two data structures: Hashtable and Binary Search Tree (BST). We will discuss their key features, use cases, and performance characteristics.

## Hashtable

A Hashtable is a data structure that allows you to store and retrieve values based on a key. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

### Key Features

- Key-value storage
- Fast average-case lookup, insertion, and deletion
- Collisions are handled using separate chaining or open addressing

### Use Cases

- When you need to store and retrieve data using keys
- When you require fast average-case performance for lookups, insertions, and deletions

### Performance

- Average-case time complexity: O(1) for insertion, deletion, and search
- Worst-case time complexity: O(n) for insertion, deletion, and search (when all keys collide)

## Binary Search Tree

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree data structure where each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. For each node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node, and all elements in the right subtree are greater than the node.

### Key Features

- Ordered storage of elements
- Supports in-order traversal, which returns elements in sorted order
- Balanced BSTs provide good average-case performance

### Use Cases

- When you need to maintain elements in a sorted order
- When you require efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations

### Performance

- Average-case time complexity (Balanced BST): O(log n) for insertion, deletion, and search
- Worst-case time complexity (Unbalanced BST): O(n) for insertion, deletion, and search

## Conclusion

Both Hashtable and Binary Search Tree have their advantages and are suitable for different use cases. Hashtable is ideal for fast key-value storage and retrieval, while Binary Search Tree is better for maintaining elements in a sorted order and providing efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations when balanced.
